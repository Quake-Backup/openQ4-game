// shots use the current, MP-resolved projectile speed, gravity and collision
// bounds, so a ballistic arc clipping cover or a teammate crossing the flight
// path is caught rather than approximated by an eye-to-target point ray.  The
// splash test projects player motion to impact time and still honours cover.

// supplied it receives the trace end position.
